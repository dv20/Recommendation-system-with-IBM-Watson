# Recommendation system with IBM Watson

In this project, we analyze users' interactions with articles on the IBM Watson Studio platform and make recommendations to them about new articles we think they will like.



## Motivation
This project aims to recommend new articles to the user based on their activity and recommend articles to the new users. The model will learn from the users' activities, make relations among them, and recommend articles based on their relations.
## Used Libraries
Numpy
Pandas
Matplotlib
pickle

## Files
Recommendations_with_IBM.html: This is the html version of the jupyter notebook, with the complete source code to implement the recommendation engine.
## Conclusion
This project recommends the top 10 articles to the new users. We calculate their similarity value with others and recommend articles that similar people found interesting for existing users. We also see the trade-off between accuracy and Latent features.
